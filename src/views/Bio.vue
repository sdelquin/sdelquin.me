      I was born in <a href="https://www.laorotava.es/">La Orotava (Tenerife)</a> back in 1979! I
      started loving
      <div class="hl">computing</div>
      quite young when I used to visit one of my father's friend. I remember he got a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> and I spent hours fooling
      with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.11</a>.

      Highschool was one of my best stages so far. There I met very
      <div class="hl">good people</div>
      and I discovered interesting subjects and fields of knowledge. My passion about computing grew
      in front of my eyes. I fondly remember
      <a href="http://www.iesrafaelarozarena.com/">IES Rafael Arozarena</a>.

      It was obvious that I was going to study Computer Science. My time at
      <a href="http://ull.es/">University of La Laguna</a> was intense but also very hard. There I
      figured out the dimension of what programming is:
      <div class="hl">a non-stop learning journey</div>
      . Fortunately I could meet there great teachers that showed me some right paths.

      Languages have played an important role in my life (not only the programming ones). Maybe this
      affection comes from my mum. In an earlier stage I finished
      <div class="hl">English</div>
      B2 Level at <a href="https://www.eoilaorotava.com/">EOI El Mayorazgo</a>. After some years I
      choose to leap on
      <div class="hl">German</div>
      B2 Level at <a href="https://www.eoipuertodelacruz.com/">EOI Puerto de la Cruz</a>.

      I can not understand my career without
      <div class="hl">teaching</div>
      . After overcoming my academic degree I decided to take the educational road. I could pass the
      official tests and got my position as teacher of higher IT studies at
      <a href="http://iespuertodelacruz.es/">IES Puerto de la Cruz - Telesforo Bravo</a>.
      Furthermore I had the chance to get involved in <a href="https://www.eoi.es/">EOI</a> as
      teacher of IT courses. I combine both teaching activities.

      Programming is a fascinating stuff for me. A set of great tech tools that lets you
      <div class="hl">create something new from scratch</div>
      . I really love it. Fortunately I have been able to learn different programming languages, but
      life changes when Python appeared on the scene. Wherever you are, thanks adsaman for being my
      mentor. I am cofounder of <a href="https://pythoncanarias.es">Python Canarias</a>.

      When I finished my degree on Computer Science I started to collaborate with
      <a href="http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/"
        >Instituto Canario de Estad√≠stica (ISTAC)</a
      >
      developing a statistical software. It's curious that 15 years later I resumed this link again.
      Nowadays I work at ISTAC doing
      <div class="hl">automation in data processing</div>
      .
