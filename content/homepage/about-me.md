{{<lni class="direction">}}I was born in [La Orotava (Tenerife)](https://www.laorotava.es/) back in 1979! I started loving **computing** quite young when I used to visit one of my father's friend. I remember he got a [Commodore Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) and I spent hours fooling with the [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) on [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x).

{{<lni class="graduation">}}Highschool was one of my best stages so far. There, I met very **good people** and I discovered interesting subjects and fields of knowledge. My passion about computing grew in front of my eyes. I fondly remember [IES Rafael Arozarena](http://www.iesrafaelarozarena.com/).

{{<lni class="invention">}} It was obvious that I was going to study Computer Science. My time at [University of La Laguna](http://ull.es/) was intense but also very hard. There I figured out the dimension of what programming is: **a non-stop learning journey**. Fortunately I could meet there great teachers that showed me some right paths.

{{<lni class="world">}}Languages have played an important role in my life (not only the programming ones). Maybe this affection comes from my mum. In an earlier stage I finished **English** B2 Level at [EOI El Mayorazgo](https://www.eoilaorotava.com/). After some years I choose to leap on **German** B2 Level at [EOI Puerto de la Cruz](https://www.eoipuertodelacruz.com/).

{{<lni class="certificate">}}I can not understand my career without **teaching**. After overcoming my academic degree I decided to take the educational road. I could pass the official tests and got my position as teacher of higher IT studies at [IES Puerto de la Cruz - Telesforo Bravo](http://iespuertodelacruz.es/). Furthermore I had the chance to get involved in EOI as teacher of IT courses. I combine both teaching activities.

{{<lni class="code-alt">}}Programming is a fascinating stuff for me. A set of great tech tools that lets you **create something new from scratch**. I really love it. Fortunately I have been able to learn different programming languages, but life changes when Python appeared on the scene. Wherever you are, thanks adsaman for being my mentor. I am cofounder of [Python Canarias](https://pythoncanarias.es/).

{{<lni class="target">}} When I finished my degree on Computer Science I started to collaborate with [Instituto Canario de Estad√≠stica (ISTAC)](http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/) developing a statistical software. It's curious that 15 years later I could resume this link. From 2020 to 2022 I worked at ISTAC as a **data engineer**.
