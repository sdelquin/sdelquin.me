Checkout out below some of my active projects.

##### {{<lni class="python">}} Python

I've built a [free online course to learn the Python programming language](https://aprendepython.es/) with a practical approach, including exercises and coverage of different levels. Only spanish! Sorry.

##### {{<lni class="amazon">}} Amazon

I'm an active customer of Amazon. Deliveries to Canary Islands usually have some issues, though. On one hand, some goods can be charged with customs duty. On the other hand, some products are not eligible for shipment to our region.

For the first point I've built a kind of [calculator of delivery costs](https://ciap.sdelquin.me/). For the second problem we've developed a cross-browser extension for [quick identification of Amazon products with shipping restrictions](https://sendhereplz.com/).

##### {{<lni class="microscope">}} Science

I've collaborated with two colegues in scientific topics. The first one has to do with [extracting haplotypes from DNA sequences](https://haplosearch.com/). The second one is a set of [utilities for Crystallographic Information Files](https://cifutils.sdelquin.me/).

##### {{<lni class="bolt">}} Education

To easily access all of the educational news from the Canary Government, I decided to automate the streaming of information through a customized service. You can achieve this thanks to this [Telegram channel](https://t.me/educannews) operated by a bot.

##### {{<lni class="flags">}} Dancing

As I said before, I'm a big fan of dancing. I created a [website with tons of salsa videos](https://susikiu.es/) from our dancing course.

##### {{<lni class="codepen">}} Artwork

I like playing around with 3D modelling and sketching. Here you can find out [some of my designs](https://files.sdelquin.me/?3d).

Although most of the photos nowadays are stored in our mobile phones, I usually take some out and upload them to a gallery site. Here you can find [photo albums of my travels](https://files.sdelquin.me/?travel).

Once in a while I used to create logos. Take an overview of [my designs](https://files.sdelquin.me/?logos).
